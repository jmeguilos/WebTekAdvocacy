						<p> According the World Health Organization,there are about 2.5 million deaths yearly for the sole reason of alcoholism around the globe. </p>
						<p> These alcohol related deaths are caused by drunk driving accidents, cancer, liver cirrhosis, heart disease and stroke. According to Dr. Saxena 
						people who are dependent on alcohol live on average 10 years less than those who do not abuse alcohol. </p>
						<p> These 2.5 million deaths mostly surround the people in the young and middle age group, instead of the old ages. </p>

				<b>PARTAKE</b> in activities, sport, relationships. <b>THINK</b> about people or things you care about and enjoy company.

				one should stick to treatment to prevent <b>RELAPSE.</b> <b>TREATMENTS</b> address the person as a whole and there are a number of <b>THERAPIES</b> 
				to check out. </p>
                <p><b>Behavioral Therapy</b> helps people with managing situations to avoid substance abuse.</p>
                <p><b>Contingency Management </b>applies reinforcement and stimuli control via feedback to help change a person’s behavior.</p>
                <p><b>Motivational Enhancement Therapy</b> is about techniques applied to quickly evoke quick motivational change as opposed to the general step by 
				step recovery process.</p>
                <p><b>Family Therapy </b>is youth friendly and approaches substance abuse recovery by introspective outlook one’s own familial circumstances and also 
				encourages other members to act and help.</p>
