When you use tobacco products, nicotine is quickly absorbed into your bloodstream. Within 10 seconds of entering your body, the nicotine reaches your brain. It causes the brain to release adrenaline, creating a buzz of pleasure and energy.

The buzz fades quickly though, and leaves you feeling tired, a little down, and wanting the buzz again. This feeling is what makes you light up the next cigarette. Since your body is able to build up a high tolerance to nicotine, you’ll need to smoke more and more cigarettes in order to get the nicotine’s pleasurable effects and prevent withdrawal symptoms.

Over time, nicotine affects the neurotransmitters in the brain, changing the way certain brain cells work. When one stops using nicotine, the changes remain for a while until the brain can revert back to its normal state. These changes are what cause the withdrawal symptoms characteristic of addiction. In fact, nicotine chemically changes the brain in a similar way to heroin and cocaine, so it’s no wonder so many tobacco users have a hard time quitting!

Once the body is free of nicotine, it no longer works in the same way it did when it had a regular supply of nicotine. It can take as long as 4 to 6 weeks for the brain to readjust to life without nicotine as it “re-learns” how to make the chemicals to stimulate the pleasure centers on its own. It is during this transition period that former nicotine users may crave nicotine or feel irritable, anxious, or depressed. But don’t worry. After some time as the brain heals, these feelings and cravings will go away. If you can fight through cravings, get support, think about medications to help, and use your coping strategies, you will succeed.
