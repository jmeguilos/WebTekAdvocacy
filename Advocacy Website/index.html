		              <h3>Drugs</h3>
		              <p>Drugs. Inhaled, swallowed, injected; originally concocted to serve medicinal purposes towards those 
					  afflicted with sickness, mankind's drive for discovery has led to the creation of substances that cure 
					  both physical and mental diseases. 
					  </p>
					  <p>However, relief, as short-lasting as it is given, can drive one to addiction. Surely, one would
					  always want comfort in their lowest of lows. The overuse and abuse of drugs can lead to an addiction:
					  an addiction that not only disillusions one's sense of reality but can also cause the devastation of
					  one's very life. A double edged blade that can both heal and damage wounds.
					  </p>
					  <p>Lives have been destroyed by the abuse of drugs. </p>

		              <h3>Alcohol</h3>
		              <p>An alcoholic drink, or alcoholic beverage, is a drink that contains a substantial amount of ethanol (informally called alcohol), a depressant which in low doses causes euphoria, reduced anxiety, and sociability and in higher doses causes intoxication (drunkenness), stupor and unconsciousness. Long-term use can lead to alcohol abuse, physical dependence, and alcoholism.</p>

		              <p>The primary addicting substance in cigarettes is nicotine. But cigarette smoke contains thousands of other chemicals that also damage health. Hazards include heart disease, lung cancer and emphysema, peptic ulcer disease, and stroke. Withdrawal symptoms of smoking include anxiety, hunger, sleep disturbances, and depression<br>
