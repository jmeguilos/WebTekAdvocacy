		              <p>Drugs. Inhaled, swallowed, injected; originally concocted to serve medicinal purposes towards those 
					  afflicted with sickness, mankind's drive for discovery has led to the creation of substances that cure 
					  both physical and mental diseases. 
					  </p>
					  <p>However, relief, as short-lasting as it is given, can drive one to addiction. Surely, one would
					  always want comfort in their lowest of lows. The overuse and abuse of drugs can lead to an addiction:
					  an addiction that not only disillusions one's sense of reality but can also cause the devastation of

					  one's very life. A double edged blade that can both heal and damage wounds.

					  one's very life. A double edged blade that can both heal and inflict wounds.

					  <p>Lives have been destroyed by the abuse of drugs. </p>

		              <h3>Alcohol</h3>
		              <p>An alcoholic drink, or alcoholic beverage, is a drink that contains a substantial amount of ethanol (informally called alcohol), a depressant which in low doses causes euphoria, reduced anxiety, and sociability and in higher doses causes intoxication (drunkenness), stupor and unconsciousness. Long-term use can lead to alcohol abuse, physical dependence, and alcoholism.</p>

						<h3>Alcohol</h3>
						<p>Alocohol. Liquor, spirits, drink; alcohol has always been imbibed and served
						amongst people. Fermented, distilled; different forms with different qualities
						and strength. In small doses, alcohol is a stimulant, letting lose one's stress
						and providing one a sense of short-term but great relief.
						</p>
						<p>However, in large doses, alcohol becomes a poison, a depressant that slows down
						the brain and the nervous system, leading to sluggish and rash actions.
						</p>
						<p>People have drowned in spirits, washing ashore the beach of despair and loneliness. </p>

		              <h3>Tobacco</h3>
		              <p>The primary addicting substance in cigarettes is nicotine. But cigarette smoke contains thousands of other chemicals that also damage health. Hazards include heart disease, lung cancer and emphysema, peptic ulcer disease, and stroke. Withdrawal symptoms of smoking include anxiety, hunger, sleep disturbances, and depression<br>

						<h3>Tobacco</h3>
					    <p>Tobacco. Cigarettes, smoking, snuff; found and used in our daily lives, tobacco is perhaps
						one of the most common forms of vice. Highly stimulating with every whiff and giving the user
						a buzz of pleasure and energy, adrenaline to the senses. Tobacco has found itself as a common 
						product, a commodity and smoking as a daily routine.
						</p>
						<p>The effect lingers for a short while and the user is left with wanting more. Chemicals from 
						the nicotine can stay for as long as six weeks and overuse of the product can lead the brain to 
						addiction, wanting more.
						</p>
						<p>You're a fool if you think smoking is cool. </p>
