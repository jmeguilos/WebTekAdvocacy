				<h3>Inhaled, swallowed, injected; originally concocted to serve medicinal purposes towards those afflicted with sickness, 
				mankind's drive for discovery has led to the creation of substances that cure both physical and mental diseases.<br><br>
                However, relief, as short-lasting as it is given, can drive one to addiction. Surely, one would
				always want comfort in their lowest of lows. The overuse and abuse of drugs can lead to an addiction:
				an addiction that not only disillusions one's sense of reality but can also cause the devastation of
				one's very life. A double edged substance that can both heal and inflict wounds.</h3>

						<p><br>According the World Health Organization,there are about 2.5 million deaths yearly for the sole reason of alcoholism around the globe. </p>
						<p>These alcohol related deaths are caused by drunk driving accidents, cancer, liver cirrhosis, heart disease and stroke. According to Dr. Saxena 
						people who are dependent on alcohol live on average 10 years less than those who do not abuse alcohol. These 2.5 million deaths mostly surround 
						the people in the young and middle age group, instead of the old ages.<br><br></p>

							<p>In the Philippines, road traffic injuries rank fourth among all causes of mortality and are the second leading cause of injury-related deaths

							reports. Three hundred seventy-one deaths were reported in Metro Manila, 51 percent of which were pedestrian deaths. <br> In 2003, 24.6 percent

 				one of the most common forms of vice. Highly stimulating with every whiff and giving the user

 				product, a commodity and smoking as a daily routine.
 				<br><br>The effect lingers for a short while and the user is left with wanting more. Chemicals from

                <p>Abuse of substances can lead to bad decisions and addiction. Recovering can be difficult for a lot of people and there are internal and 
				external factors to take in but prevention is indeed doable. Community-based prevention programs present everywhere, even in your local community.<br> <br>
                If you are <b>STRESSED</b> or <b>DEPRESSED</b>, find coping methods like exercise, meditation or groups in your local community. <b>SEEK OUT</b> 
				therapists and counseling, and converse with people you’re comfortable with. <b>FIND</b> a lifestyle that suites you, hobbies that entertain you. 
				<b>PARTAKE</b> in activities, sport, relationships. <b>THINK</b> about people or things you care about and enjoy company.

                <p>In the medical field, addiction is considered a chronic and progressive brain disease. Addiction <b>CAN</b> be cured. Or at the very least, 
				managed and controlled. <b>WITHDRAWAL</b> is the anxiety one feels when starting to curb addiction and while it may be difficult to maintain, 
				one should stick to treatment to prevent <b>RELAPSE.</b> <b>TREATMENTS</b> address the person as a whole and there are a number of <b>THERAPIES</b> 
				to check out.</p>
                <p><b>Behavioral Therapy</b> helps people with managing situations to avoid substance abuse.</p>
                <p><b>Contingency Management </b>applies reinforcement and stimuli control via feedback to help change a person’s behavior.</p>
                <p><b>Motivational Enhancement Therapy</b> is about techniques applied to quickly evoke quick motivational change as opposed to the general step by 
				step recovery process.</p>
                <p><b>Family Therapy </b>is youth friendly and approaches substance abuse recovery by introspective outlook one’s own familial circumstances and also 
				encourages other members to act and help.</p>
