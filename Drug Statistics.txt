It is estimated that almost a quarter of a billion people 
between the ages of 15 and 64 years used an illicit drug in 
2013. 
This corresponds to a global prevalence of 5.2 per 
cent (range: 3.4-7.0 per cent), suggesting that drug use 
has remained stable in the past three years, although the 
estimated number of drug users has actually risen by 6 
million to 246 million (range: 162 million-329 million) 
owing to the increase in the global population. 
With some 27 million people (range: 15.7 million-39 million), 
or 0.6 per cent of the population aged 15-64, estimated to suffer 
from problem drug use, including drug-use disorders or 
drug  dependence,  problem  drug  use  seems  to  have  
remained somewhat stable over this three-year period.

It is estimated that in 2014 there were 207,400 (range: 113,700 – 250,100) drug-related deaths with overdose accounting for up to a half of all deaths and with opioids involved in most cases.

Drug-related deaths in Asia are tentative because of poor regional coverage and reporting of mortality data. However, it is estimated that there were between 13,600 and 100,700 deaths in 2013.

<p>Tobacco. Cigarettes, smoking, snuff; found and used in our daily lives, tobacco is perhaps
 -				one of the most common forms of vice. Highly stimulating with every whiff and giving the user
 -				a buzz of pleasure and energy, adrenaline to the senses. Tobacco has found itself as a common 
 -				product, a commodity and smoking as a daily routine.
 -				</p>
 -				<p>The effect lingers for a short while and the user is left with wanting more. Chemicals from 
 -				the nicotine can stay for as long as six weeks and overuse of the product can lead the brain to 
 -				addiction, wanting more.
 -				</p>
 -				<p>You're a fool if you think smoking is cool. </p>
